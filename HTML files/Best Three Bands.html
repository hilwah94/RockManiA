            1. Led Zeppelin
        </h2>

        <p>Was there really ever any other way this would end? Sure, there are worthy</p>
        <p>contenders all the way through this list; bands you could credibly argue should</p>
        <p>be in with a shot at the top spot. But when the chips are down, and push comes</p>
        <p>to shove, there's really only one way this could've gone: Led Zeppelin are the</p>
        <p>greatest rock band in history.</p>

            2. Queen
        </h3>

        <p>Queen were such a uniquely talented band that genre identification is virtually</p>
        <p>impossible. They could certainly rock as hard as anyone, but there are also</p>
        <p>elements of metal, jazz, funk, opera, vaudeville and ragtime in their music.</p>

            3. Pink Floyd
        </h4>

        <p>through the 80s and 90s, angst-ridden teenagers, including legions who later would also make an impact</p>
        <p>with their own music â€“ from Axl Rose to Trent Reznor to Billy Corgan to Noel Gallagher</p>
        <p>grew up listening to The Wall.Pink Floyd had an impact on them all</p>
